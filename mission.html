    <!-- Mission Statement -->
    <section>
      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of this organization is to embrace the love of sports for those who love it.
        It is to inspire them through the love of sports by providing a space where they can learn, play, and grow.
        Many children are sitting at home with a skill that can take them far in life — and South Africa is not doing anything about that.
        That is where this organization comes in: to empower those who love sport.
        To remind them that their love for sport is powerful and valid.
        This organization will put those young players in the spotlight, to engage them with countries from outside.
        In township language they say: <span class="highlight">“ikasi linetalent – sifuna ukubonisa”</span> (kasi has talent, we want to show it).
        That is our main AIM — to show the world that talent does not come from a specific area but EVERYWHERE.
      </p>

    <!-- Aim of the Project -->
    <section>
      <h1>Aim of the Project</h1>
      <p>
        The main aim of this project is to help those who love sports to learn more about it and reach their goals.
        We will help them strive for a better future. This may also help them avoid bad influences like drugs, teenage pregnancy, and negative peer pressure.
        We aim to bring change in township society. We want to see boys and girls from ekasi go far in the world of sports — <span class="highlight">“Sifuna uk’vulela ama chance”</span>.
        There is a lot of talent ekasi and the world doesn’t realize it because it only focuses on certain areas.
        LOXION LEGENDS is here to put a spotlight on overlooked areas — townships — where true talent lives.

    <!-- Action Plan -->
    <section>
      <h1>Action Plan</h1>
      <p>
        In the first month, we will visit township schools (from primary to high school) and talk to principals about including sports in their timetable.
        In month two, we will host our first sports days at each school to identify learners who are enthusiastic about playing — the ones with real kasi fire.
        Month five is for taking it up a notch — organising games with schools from other provinces, giving our players proper exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In month six, we will invite scouts, local teams, and coaches to come spot talent — <span class="highlight">abantwana abashisa ngempela</span>.
        In month seven, we will launch fundraising campaigns, asking local businesses and sponsors to support us with kits, equipment, and transport.
        By months eight and nine, we will bring in sports role models to motivate the learners and post progress on social media to keep the kasi engaged.
        Month ten will focus on building partnerships and training volunteers to assist.
        Finally, in months eleven and twelve, we will reflect on the progress, make improvements, and host a final year-end tournament to celebrate our young legends.
